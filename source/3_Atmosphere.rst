The atmosphere of Somnium is crafted from the very best textures and mods we could find among the community, plus many new assets and textures made by the wonderful artists from the team at Scenic Route Games. And everything works in tandem to paint Enderal into a vivid new Age of Sail setting.

From the lazy, leaden waves of the Sun Coast, to the ravaged and ruined sprawl of Thalgard; all throughout the continent players will find scenic vistas as they wander and explore. Then when they delve into the depths and halls beneath the soil they will find oppressive shadows and haunted stones.

Equipment and Attire
--------------------

The denizens of Enderal now sport a whole new array of clothing that fits the time period we've placed upon the world. You will see lengthy coats, top hats, and glorious gowns decorating the citizens of Ark.  

Beyond the clothing of everyday citizens, those of a rougher persuasion will find their tools have changed too. Plate armor has faded into obscurity and the weapons designed to combat it followed soon after. Now is an age of the duelist. The people of the world will sport a variety of new blades.

Curved blades cut quickly and deeply, bleeding the foe. Old fashioned heavy and straight blades still stand on their own merits of heafty blows. And the long, flexible piercing blades denote those fighters that rely wholly on their agility to emerge victorious from any bout.

User Interface
--------------

The HUD and UI have been updated as well. Somnium's user interface was chosen for its cleanliness and minimalist design. With the game designed now to be played in third person the HUD was manipulated to fit this choice by ensuring it is tucked out of the way, but that all the necessary information is available as needed.

Anomalies
---------

And so we come to the heart. Anomalies are a feature completely unique to Somnium, and they will change your game completely as you play. These events are tied to your Arcane Fever. As the fever builds inside you, your grip on this reality begins to slip and the many other eventualities of the Sea bleed into this world.

Alien sounds ring without a source, phantoms and nightmares haunt your steps, and even the things you believe to be real will prove you a liar.

If you let the fever grow to even higher levels, to the dangerous peaks of what your brain can handle, your sight will fully change; color might fade to greyscale, and time might seem to pass you by at unnatural rates.

Anomalies cause the gameplay of Somnium to be in a constant flux state. As your fever builds and wanes you experience the world in completely different ways. Somnium is designed to work with this flux state, to allow these anomalies to influence the game while also keeping it running and moving along smoothly and even tying most of the other core mechanics to these. 

Players should not expect to play through the game and remain entirely sane. Arcane Fever is built into many of the powerful tools at the characters fingers and these anomalies come with the fever.
