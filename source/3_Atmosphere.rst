The atmosphere of Somnium is crafted from the very best textures and mods we could find among the community, plus many new assets and textures made by the wonderful artists from the team at Scenic Route Games. And everything works in tandem to paint Enderal into a vivid new Age of Sail setting.

From the lazy, leaden waves of the Sun Coast, to the ravaged and ruined sprawl of Thalgard; all throughout the continent players will find scenic vistas as they wander and explore. Then when they delve into the depths and halls beneath the soil they will find oppressive shadows and haunted stones.

Equipment and Attire

The denizens of Enderal now sport a whole new array of clothing that fits the time period we've placed upon the world. You will see lengthy coats, top hats, and glorious gowns decorating the citizens of Ark.  

Beyond the clothing of everyday citizens, those of a rougher persuasion will find their tools have changed too. Plate armor has faded into obscurity and the weapons designed to combat it followed soon after. Now is an age of the duelist. The people of the world will sport a variety of new blades and armored vestments.

Curved blades cut quickly and deeply, bleeding the foe. Old fashioned heavy and straight blades still stand on their own merits of balanced, hefty blows. And the long, flexible piercing blades denote those fighters that rely wholly on their agility and precision to emerge victorious from any bout.

User Interface
--------------

The HUD and UI have been updated as well. Somnium's user interface was chosen for its cleanliness and minimalist design. With the game designed now to be played in third person the HUD was manipulated to fit this choice by ensuring it is tucked out of the way, but that all the necessary information is available as needed.

However, Somnium's HUD marks a drastic shift from the Skyrim standard. Instead of the three seperated bars constantly appearing and disapearing across your screen, now all have been merged together. If you are having an initial difficulty with the HUD, below is a representation of where each bar now resides and the direction it drains. When a certain bar is empy it will also flash its dedicated color (red for helath, green for stamina, and blue for mana) when you are attempting to use an ability that requires the missing resource.

The World

The continent of Enderal has never looked so good. Colors pop everywhere you travel. Sunlight crisps into golden rays as it droops behind the ocean. Mushrooms glaze the depths into an alien, emerald green. And the clear waters of the Sun Coast beg travelers to take the moment and soak in the refreshing chill.

And as you forge your way into the more dangerous climates and locations, the mood changes to match these locals with new and expanded weathers and lighting.

In the great city of Ark, the Holy Order has been forced to rely on evermore extreme methods of keeping the peace as the world unravels around them. Print has allowed a new form of propoganda to flourish in the city, and you will find an array of posters placed all over the city.

Anomalies

And so we come to the heart. Anomalies are a feature completely unique to Somnium, and they will change your game completely as you play. These events are tied to your Arcane Fever. As the fever builds inside you, your grip on this reality begins to slip and the many other eventualities of the Sea bleed into this world.

Alien sounds ring without a source, phantoms and nightmares haunt your steps, and even the things you believe to be real will prove you a liar.

If you let the fever grow to even higher levels, to the dangerous peaks of what your brain can handle, your sight will fully change; color might fade, and time might seem to pass you by at unnatural rates.

Anomalies cause the gameplay of Somnium to be in a constantly fluxuating state. As your fever builds and wanes you will experience the world in completely different ways. Somnium is designed to work with this fluxuating state, to allow these anomalies to influence the game while also keeping it running and moving along smoothly and even tying most of the other core mechanics to these. 

Players should not expect to play through the game and remain entirely sane. Arcane Fever is built into many of the powerful tools at the character's fingers and these anomalies come with the fever.
