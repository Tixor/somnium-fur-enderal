Frequently Asked Questions

**Why is my game in German?**
 - Unfortunately, it seems you did not read the installation instructions!  Somnium is defaulted to German voice over with English Subtitles.  If you prefer English audio, uncheck the ``German Voice Files`` mod in the left pane of Mod Organizer 2.

**I have a suggestion!**

Setup and Installation
----------------------

**What are all the unchecked mods in MO2?**
 - These are all intentional. I recommend ignoring everything except the "Optional Plugins" at the bottom of the left pane, which are described in the readme.

**How do I improve my framerate?**
 - We have packaged a few ENB presets with Somnium and the installation process is detailed in the installation section.  Select the low preset if you are struggling to run the game at a proper framerate.

**What difficulty setting is recommended?**
 - Somnium is built around adept difficulty and this is the optimal experience.  The game is difficult but if you would like to increase the difficulty, please feel free!
