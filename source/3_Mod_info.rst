What Is This?
=============
This page is dedicated to describing the important mods in this modlist. Note that certain mods will be purposefully omitted here for the purpose of keeping some mystery and suspence. This includes many of the mods that Apoapse has custom-made specifically for this modlist.

The List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*
  **Enderal Gameplay Overhaul** [\ `Nexus <https://www.nexusmods.com/enderalspecialedition/mods/3>`_\ ] The central gameplay overhaul is Enderal Gameplay Overhaul, or EGO. It includes a ton of balance changes, improvements to AI, new gameplay mechanics, new weapons, spells, and potions, and much more. To go over everything this mod does would take many paragraphs, so we encourage you to visit the mod page to see all it does. Note that some details may be different due to all our other mods and tweaks, so just use it to get a general idea.
*  
  **Engarde** [\ `Nexus <https://www.nexusmods.com/enderalspecialedition/mods/32>`_\ ] Speaking of other mods, this one overwrites/further enhances many of the combat changes that EGO makes. Melee combat is no longer a slapping contest, with fights feeling like that have actual weight to them. It removes much of the RNG out of fights, such as completely random chances to stagger. It uses a simple formula of comparing the weight of the weapon vs the weight of the target to determine if stagger happens. If the weapon is heavy enough in comparison, then it will always stagger. Check out the mod page for more details.
*
  **True Directional Movement** [\ `Nexus <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614>`_\ ] Our camera mod is True Directional Movement. Unlike Librum and vanilla Skyrim, Somnium is designed to be played in 3rd person. We use several mods to help make this attractive for players, the first and most important of which is this mod. Don't let the title fool you, this plugin does far more than what the name suggests. You can move and attack in any direction, lock onto a target like you'd expect in other 3rd person games, enemies get health bars and bosses get revamped large special ones, and much more.
*
  **SmoothCam** [\ `Nexus <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252>`_\ ] SmoothCam is the other important mod for making 3rd person gameplay fun. It completely replaces how camera works in general, making it look as good looking as any game that didn't have first person at all. This is something that is best understood by just watching footage, so check out the mod page to see plenty. Note that the specifics of the camera's behavior is heavily customizable, so what you see in these videos will be different from how it will look in our modlist.
*
  **Apoapse's Anomalies** It's a secret(for now)!
*
  **Apoapse's Arsenal** This is an (as of yet) unreleased mod made exclusively for this modlist. It introduces guns as the primary type of weapon. One Handed/Two Handed/Archery are turned into Fencing/Pistol/Marksmanship, with the first covering all melee weapons and the last covering long guns and bows to an extent.
*
  **Apoapse's Auguries** It's a secret(for now)!
*
  **Skyrim Souls** [\ `Nexus <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27859>`_\ ] When you describe this mod, it doesn't sound impressive on the surface. It unpauses Skyrim's menus. All of them. How different could that possibly be? Once you start thinking about it, you'll begin to understand how it completely changes how you play the game. 
*
  **Playable Half Starling Race** [\ `Nexus <https://www.nexusmods.com/enderalspecialedition/mods/100>`_\ ] Lets you play as Half Starlings from Enderal. 
*
  **IHarvest** [\ `Nexus <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27789>`_\ ] IHarvest gives a special spell that lets you autoharvest everything in a radius around you.
*
  **KataPUMB New Affinities** [\ `Nexus <https://www.nexusmods.com/enderalspecialedition/mods/3>`_\ ] Adds 14 new classes to Enderal. Highly recommended to read the mod page if you want to know everything about all the new classes.
*
  **Quick Loot RE** [\ `Nexus <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21085>`_\ ] This mod adds a looting menu akin to the one present in FO4. Simple, but very useful especially with Skyrim Souls being present.
*
  **Quick Light SE** [\ `Nexus <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12633>`_\ ] Simple mod that lets you spawn a light source as either a floating orb that follows you or a lantern attached to your waist.
*
  **KataPUMB Spell Package** [\ `Nexus <https://www.nexusmods.com/enderalspecialedition/mods/159>`_\ ] Adds 41 new spell archetypes for a grand total of 173 spells which are integrated within Enderal leveled lists. Worth reading the mod page to see all the spells and their effects.
*
  **Sink or Swim** [\ `Nexus <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42962`_\ ] Makes water interactions be how they should have been in the first place. On top of slowing you and NPCs down based on how deep in the water they're in, this introduces a FO4-esque Power Armour system where you will walk underwater if wearing full heavy armour.  
*
  **Uninterrupted Invisibility** [\ `Nexus <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21729>`_\ ] Stops the game from removing invisiblity on you if you interact with something. Quality of life feature that makes invisibility much more viable.
