*A flock of gulls brays against the clouds and a man stumbles through the streets. He mumbles to himself in words and incantations of other lives. His shoulder strikes a passerby and he stumbles to the cobbles. He raises himself in a hurry, his eyes darting frantically to the shadowed alleyways where it hides. It shouldn’t be here, not among so many others. The apartment is not far. The shadows goad him as he flees, they wait eagerly with an insatiable hunger. He crashes up the stairs and locks himself into the safety of home. Even here the whispers find him. He throws open cupboards, dropping dishes and glasses to the floor. It has to be here, this is where he left it. And then there it is, like a light at sea. He greedily takes the vial into his hands and brings the lips to his own, eagerly accepting the kiss of ambrosia and the calm it brings.*

*She sets the hammer with a slender thumb. The vatyr snorts and growls somewhere beyond the brush and she wipes a bead of sweat from her face. Its sounds grow closer, her arm comes up. She moves an index finger to the trigger and waits. Branches snap, leaves shift, and a smell of matted hair stands her own. The beast stalks into the clearing. It walks on back feet and the knuckles of the forepaws, but then it stands. Suddenly the pistol feels inadequate. Her left hand finds a vial at her belt and withdraws it as she steps back from the assailant. It roars at her and her gun drops to the foliage below as the vial comes to her lips and the mutagen courses through her body. She changes, painfully. Her limbs grow to match the beast’s and a ravenous smile plays across her maw in razored fangs.*

*And deep under the soil, in some forgotten hall of the long dead, you run a rag along your blade. It drips with the blood of the lost ones, the decaying bodies of those turned from the Path. They live again in crimson, a red madness that grips the land. Your head burns as you ready yourself for the room ahead. You can hear whispers crawling from the darkness around you. You trace a sign and a tiny globe casts the room into a cold light. You pinch your eyes closed against the pain that swells in your head. You know what comes next, you can read the history of this foe in the fiendish marks along your arms. But the nightmare ends here. You steel yourself and step into the fray.*

If you're reading this, then there's a good chance that you've played or heard of our other project, Librum. While that project focuses on an all-encompassing overhaul of *Skyrim,* this project seeks to do the same but within the world of Enderal. Born from the ashes of Enderal My Way, with the blessing of the original maintainer, this project seeks to put our own unique spin and perspective onto another incredible world, changing it into something different, more dangerous, and with excitement around every corner.

The world of Enderal has not been fundamentally changed; rather, many aspects have been re-interpreted or remastered. The graphics and atmosphere have been hand-selected to offer the best looking version of Enderal available, complete with a custom ENB and shaders, weather effects and sounds.

Lots of new content has been introduced to the gameworld. This includes many new spells, dungeons, player homes, and more, all chosen to blend naturally within the Enderal world but to contribute to the Somnium vision.

Combat is overhauled in such a way that it resembles games like Dark Souls. This is primarily done through Engarde, True Directional Movement, SmoothCam, Skyrim Souls, Apoapse's Anchorage, Apoapse's Affliction and a few other mods to push it in the direction of these games. Stamina and Mana are handled much differently, as mana regenerates near-immediately when depleted and stamina is regained in clever ways that reward careful and tactical play.

Magic has been changed appropriately, to mimic the Souls-like combat we've introduced. Importantly, magic is implemented in a setting-adapted Vancian system; the first perk in the Magic tree is Augury, and it allows you to "prepare" spells by reaching into the Sea of Eventualities and gathering energies. Unprepared spells are near-impossible to cast for all but the most skilled wizards. Each spell preparation worsens your Arcane Fever by a certain amount but drastically lowers the cost of the prepared spell.

This is the meat of Somnium: Arcane Fever. As your Fever worsens, your perception of the world around you is overtaken by the Sea of Eventualities. You will hear strange and disembodied voices, see things that may not exist, not see things that may exist, and possibly not even be able to rely on your own abilities. Just remember, the wind chimes are only the beginning.

Fundamentally, **Somnium is a horror game, and it is not for the faint of heart.** We highly recommend playing with headphones on and the lights off for the optimal experience.
