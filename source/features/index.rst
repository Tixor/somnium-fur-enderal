The Somnium Vision
==================

Somnium significantly affects nearly every aspect of gameplay; in this section, we will explain all of the significant changes that have been made, and how they change the Somnium experience. I will separate it here into various "modules" for ease of explanation -- however, this does not reflect any clean-cut separations of Somnium mechanics. Changes from the various modules overlap, affect one another, and work together to create a consistent Somnium experience. For instance, Apoapse's Augury forces mages to interact with the core arcane fever gameplay loop.  The increase in arcane fever, in turn, may cause players to interact with the Affliction system to heal it and the Anchorage system to bring them back to the world after death.

With this in mind, here is a rough breakdown of what Somnium accomplishes. Please see the tabs to the left for each facet of gameplay.

With every change, Somnium attempts to adhere to the points of its **core philosophy**:

#. Core tenet 1
#. Core tenet 2
#. Core tenet 3
