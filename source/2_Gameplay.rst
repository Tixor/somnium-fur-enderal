Somnium is designed to be played in third person. Great effort has been made to bring this game into the modern feel of popular action games. You are able to lock on to targets, dodge with a keypress, your ranged weapons have a proper aiming line so that you can easily tell where you will hit while in third person, and your power attacks are accomplished with a modifying-key rather than a held normal input.

Controls
--------

The end result of this effort allows somnium to be playable in third person from beginning to end, and this is the designed method of play.

However, these changes also brought necessary changes to the base controls of the game. Somnium adds elements from other genres into the world of Vyn, and many of these elements come with a standardized expectation of controls from players.

Take, for instance, guns. Somnium adds a vast array of firearms for the character to wield, and these require ammunition to be loaded for use. Most modern games use the **'R'** key to reload their firearms; this has become an assumed norm. But in Enderal, Skyrim, and most other Bethesda games, the **'R'** key is used to draw and stow weapons. We decided that having the **'R'** key control reload was more important than drawing/stowing, and so the vanilla keybind needed to be changed (it is now bound to the **'T'** key).

The controls for Somnium were decided after some playtesting with various control-schemes, and we ended up with what we felt was the most comfortable blend of expectation and function that we could find.

The image below shows the default control set-up for Somnium.

You can bring up this image in-game at any time by pressing the **'Page Down'** key. Do note, however, that this is a static image and it will not change to reflect any alterations you might make to the controls.

The image color codes sections to reflect genrealized groupings of use. Purple are menu keys, Green are combat keys, and Red are utility keys. Gray/Black keys are for basic movement. Going through this image I will quickly list the actions each icon connects to:

.. _controlsPurple-reference-lable:

Purple
^^^^^^

* Starting at the top left we have the **'Escape'** key, which does as you would expect and opens the settings menu for the game. You will notice that the options here may not match what you are used to, we will discuss that in the :ref:`Death-reference-lable` section.
* Below that is the **'Tab'** key which opens the typical middle-menu for Enderal allowing you to choose between the Inventory, Map, and Magic sections.
* The **'Z'** key opens your favorites menu while you are exploring.
* The **'Y'** key uses your meditation power, which takes you to the shrine area to spend your memory, skill, and craft points after you level up.
* The **'U'** key opens your ammo pouch, allowing you to equip different forms of ammunition for your guns.
* The **'I'** key opens the Inventoty screen without needing to enter the middle-menu.
* The **'H'** key opens the Hero menu, which shows the player their character's stats and current XP.
* The **'J'** key opens the player's Journal, showing your quests.
* The **'K'** key opens the Magic screen without needing to enter the middle-menu.
* The **'M'** key enters opens the Map screen without needing to enter the middle-menu.
* And the **'End'** key opens a notebook for you to take in game notes if you would like.

.. _controlsGreen-reference-lable:

Green
^^^^^

* The **'R'** key reloads your equipped firearm. You need a form of ammuntion selected for use in the *Ammo Pouch* for this to work.
* The **'Left Shift'** key operates as a modifier, changing your movement into sprinting, and your attacks into power attacks.
* The **'C'** key activates the lock-on.
* The **'Left Control'** key enters the stealth mode.
* And the **'Left Alt'** key activates your dodge, or defensive movement, which is a slide.

.. _controlsRed-reference-lable:

Red
^^^

* The **'Q'** key activates your belt-light, illuminating dark areas.
* The **'F'** key activates your equipped talent (read: Power).
* The **'G'** key calls your *Aparition* if you use the Phasmalist tree.
* The **'V'** key calls your mount, assuming you have a mount.

.. _controlsExtra-reference-lable

Extra
^^^^^

* The **'T'** key draws and stows your equipped weapon.
* The **'O'** key toggles a shoulder swap, allowing you to choose which angle of third person you want to be using at any given time
* The **'P'** key toggles your POV, though with Somnium you will want to play predominantly in third person.
* The **Scroll Wheel** will allow you to quickly choose between targets while the *lock on* is active. 
* The **'Caps Lock'** key will switch between your run and walk movements.
* And the **'Right Alt'** key will toggle auto-move on and off.

.. _Death-reference-lable:

Death
-----

Somnium is designed to be a challenging action/thriller experience. Combat is dangerous for all parties involved and the player has a greatly expanded suite of option they can use to build their character up against the dangers. In the beginning you might die fairly often, you are weak and have the fewest tools at your disposal.

In Somnium, death does not toss you back to a previous save. Instead, dying causes you to resurrect back at the last Earthen Reliquary that you activated.

(Earthen Reliquary Picture)

No one else even seems capable of noticing these petrified birds, nor do they seem to hear their rumbling call. But as you stand before them you can feel the power and sorrow of other lives, of other worlds, rolling upon you like gentle waves of some distant Sea.

These avian shrines act as checkpoints. At most of them you are able to open an unlimited storage, skip time, and restore your Humanity. 

The Reliquaries utilize a shared storage, allowing you to stock your loot into them out in the wilds and then draw it out in batches to sell back in town. You can also store useful preperation equipment such as buffing potions and the, now-heavy, Ambrosia.

The Wait function is limited to these shrines as well. If a quest requires you to be somewhere at a specific time of day, you can quickly pass the time at a nearby shrine and make it to the location.

.. _deathHumanity-reference-lable:

Humanity
^^^^^^^^
Restoring your Humanity is an important function of the Reliquaries. As you die, your humanity is sapped from you based on the Fever level you held when you died. As your Humanity slips from you, you are subjected to increasingly detrimental effects to your Stamina and Mana pools. If your Humanity is ever completely lost, your story ends.

Characters can restore their humanity at most Earthen Reliquaries by sacrificing a /*Memory of the Past*/_. These fragments of other times and lives are rare to find, but the first visit to every shrine grants you one, and there are certain entities in the world of Enderal that possess memories powerful enough to use in this process should you be able to overcome their challenge.

.. _deathSaving-reference-lable:

Saving
^^^^^^
Players will quickly notice that the settings menu no longer offers a ``Save`` function. The Earthen Reliquaries operate as your save points. Everytime you back out from an Earthen Reliquary's menu your game will be automatically saved. This usually only takes a moment, but could stretch slightly longer as you progress in the game. **Please do not close the game while it is saving.** Some Reliquaries will not open a menu, for these simply activating them causes the save to begin.

The game also autosaves your progress every minute, making sure that you don't lose any progress should you need to log off without a shrine near. When you load your game after this, it will still spawn you at the last shrine you activated, however you will have all the progress you accomplished still standing, and will only need to find your way back to the location you logged out from.

While engaging in the story path (major quests), and not simply exploring and doing side quests, it is recommended to log out after a shrine-save due to the way that scripting can affect autosaves.

.. _Combat-reference-lable:

Combat
------

As stated earlier, combat in Somnium is dangerous. Low level characters are fragile and death will come quickly. As you level up, explore, and find/make better gear you will quickly rise in power.

There are a lot of options available to characters from the get-go than they have in default Enderal. You can dodge away from enemy attacks now, giving a powerful defensive technique to every character that can make even low level characters capable if the player knows how to use it.

.. _combatEarly-reference-lable:

Early Game
^^^^^^^^^^
When your character is just starting out you have everything against you. It is the coinciding moment moment where you have the least game-knoledge, the lowest skills, the fewest perks, the least talents, and the weakest gear. But, you will quickly begin to fix all of these even as you explore the starting area. 

There are three core goals of the early game:

#. Experiment with the weapons and armor you find.
#. Be frugal with your use of talents and magic.
#. Don't be afraid to get your teeth kicked in a few times.

Because Enderal does not use the typical Skyrim style of character growth, with skills only raising with use, all characters are free to make use of a variety of weapons to get the job done without fear of missing the experience gain in their primary skills.

The early game will mostly be made up of learning experiences. And this is fine. Number two exists to incentivize keeping your Arcane Fever low. It does not ask that you never use your spells and talents, but instead to use them intelligently. Maybe plan to get into most fights using none of your magic and powers for the first go so that you can learn more about the enemies. Then you can come back, armed with that knowledge and your spells/powers to win the fight. 

With the respawn mechanics, death is not as much an inhibitor to progress. Instead it allows you to quickly regroup and strategize better angles to approach a camp from, or better tools to bring with you when you go back to that dungeon. So long as your fever is kept low, death is mostly a time setback. Plus, you are given a few *Memories* at the start if you explore and search for them, so you can safely know you'll be able to recouperate your Humanity a few times if you do end up dying a lot with a high fever level.

.. _combatGuns-reference-lable:

Firearms
^^^^^^^^
(Firearms Picture Here)

You should find an example of each basic firearm archetype before you even fully depart from the introductory dungeon.

Guns give characters a very powerful ranged option so long as they have the ammunition. Even without perks, these weapons work great as an opener for any character build. While exploring, even a mage-based character could make use of a pistol to kill minor targets without needing to cast their spells and therefore build up their fever even further.

And not only can any character make use of guns, but they are encouraged to do so. Somnium plays, in many ways, like a shooter. The inclusion of guns fundamentally alters the expectations of engagements.


.. _Magic-reference-lable:

Magic
-----
(Cool Picture of Dual Summoning Casting with Runes)

Magic was always a major theme and feature of Enderal's world. But in Somnium, the interesting quirks of Enderal's magic lore have been brought into focus.

.. _magicFever-reference-lable:

Arcane Fever
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Arcane Fever, a horrible side effect faced by all who can wield magic on Vyn, is now at center stage. For every spell, the aspiring arcanist must reach for the effect across the infinity that is the Sea of Eventualities. They do this with the new magic talent: *Augury*.

Using this talent to prepare spells brings the toll of the fever's growth upon the caster, but it also reduces their cost. And some spells, those that deal in the more personal invitations to the Sea, cause a constant uptick of this fever for as long as they are active. 

Spells are not the only fever inducing aspect of the character either. Your talents from all memory trees will slowly cause the fever to rise as well, though they have been made more available by reducing their cooldowns.

And of course this fever is fueled further by imbibing any potions touched by magic and by proximity to residual magic energy in the world.

.. _magicMore-reference-lable:

Spell Expansion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The number of spell effects have been greately increased as well. Players will find a vast array of spells to use for each magical discipline.

Players will find offensive Light Magic spells that will help them to better combat the Lost Ones, effective touch spells for the battlemage clad in heavy armor to put to use, new summons that can be paired together so the mage never needs to be in harms way, and many more.

With all of these, magic becomes a very effective and versitile skill set for the players that want to walk the line with their Arcane Fever.
