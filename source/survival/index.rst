Survival Guide
==============

This guide will help you get off the ground in Librum -- Librum changes a great deal about Skyrim's world, inhabitants, and mechanics, and you'll need to familiarize yourself with the new rules of the road. If you have not done so yet, read the preceding sections to install Librum and learn a little about it. This guide is in continual development as Librum continues to enhance and refine the experience of playing the game.
