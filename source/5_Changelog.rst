Changelog
=========

| **v1.0**
| New, Unique-to-Somnium Features:

* *Apoapse's Arsenal.* The game now takes place in an early "Age of Sail" era, and new rifles, pistols, and other firearms are the focus of the game's combat. Combat skills have been split into melee, pistols, and long guns, and memory trees and affinities have changed alongside. Firearms use top-notch assets and custom animations, and they are distributed throughout the game exactly as any other weapon in Enderal. More rudimentary weapons, and bows in particular, are now much less common.
* *Apoapse's Augury.* Spellcasting now makes use of a pseudo-Vancian system. Although Mana regenerates near-instantly once dropped below 50%, you need to *prepare* spells ahead of combat using the all-new power *Augury*, which can be obtained as the first perk in the magic memory tree cluster. Augury can be used without limit, but it increases your Arcane Fever with each spell preparation.
* *Apoapse's Anomalies.* This will remain largely secret, to prevent spoiling the game's atmosphere. In effect, Somnium transitions from a dark adventure game to a true horror experience as your Arcane Fever increases. *Anomalies* has been the cumulative effort of professional artists, musicians, and designers, and I hope you all enjoy the effect.
